These are a bunch of sample lib's  that helped me learn 
OS/2 EE's Database Manager. It is setup as a SQL API, instead of
the embedded SQL that you would normaly use. since it is dynamic, 
it is not as fast as I would like it yet. Also I have not received any
OS/2 DBM Mauuals yet, so there are probally lots of enhancement that 
could be made. I put this out so that somebody with more knowledge
get enhance it, also to educate people who may not have gotten this far.

Since this is my first time working with SQL from within a language,
This may not be the best apporch.
